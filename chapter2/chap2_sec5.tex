\section{Limitation of Standard Method}
The standard method $C_{n-k+1}$ is a widely used approach to solve various problems, including itemset mining.
However, its major drawback lies in the explosion of combinations,
especially when $k$ approaches $n / 2 + 1$.

In a simple example, with $n = 30$ and $\lambda = 16$,
the number of clauses required to encode $C_{15}^{30}$ is approximately 155 million.
In reality, $n$ corresponds to the number of transactions, which can range from thousands to millions.
Therefore, the standard method is not feasible for large datasets.

Moreover, solving problems using the standard method can be time-consuming and resource-intensive.
The computational complexity increases exponentially with the size of the input.
As a result, the standard method has limitations in handling large-scale datasets efficiently.

Additionally, the standard method has a small limit on the size of the input it can handle.
When the number of transactions or the dimensionality of the problem exceeds a certain threshold,
the standard method becomes impractical and fails to provide accurate results.

These limitations highlight the need for alternative approaches that can overcome
the drawbacks of the standard method
and efficiently handle large-scale datasets with complex problem structures.
