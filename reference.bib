abstract = {A planning methodology for nonholonomic mobile manipulators in the presence of obstacles is developed. The method employs smooth and continuous functions, such as polynomials, and it is very fast, easy to use and computationally inexpensive. The core of the method is based on mapping the nonholonomic constraint to a space where it can be satisfied trivially. In this paper, the method is first extended to include polygonal obstacles of any kind, allowing for less conservative workspace representations. The algebraic nature of the methodology and its advantages are retained. To improve the performance of the method in finding collision-free paths with smaller length, two techniques are studied in detail. The first uses intermediate path points and the second exploits the periodicity of the trigonometric functions involved. The proposed methodology is also extended to the case of obstacles that are moving in the workspace with a priori known trajectories. This case is illustrated by an example of great application interest, in which the end-point follows a desired Cartesian trajectory while the platform and the manipulator follow valid and collision-free paths connecting given initial and final points. Additional illustrative examples demonstrate the planning methodologies in a variety of obstructed spaces.}

The main contribution focuses on an optimal, cooperative, collision avoidance for a multi-robot system where the velocities and accelerations of the mobile robots are constrained and the start and the goal velocity are defined for each robot. The optimal path of each robot, from the start pose to the goal pose, is obtained by minimizing the penalty function, which takes into account the sum of all the path lengths subjected to the distances between the robots, which should be larger than the minimum distance defined as the safety distance, and subjected to the velocities and accelerations, which should be lower than the maximum allowed for each robot. The model-predictive trajectory tracking is used to drive the robots on the obtained reference paths. The results of the path planning, real experiments and some future work ideas are discussed.},

    abstract = { In spray painting applications, it is essential to generate a spray gun trajectory such that the entire surface is completely covered and receives an acceptably uniform layer of paint deposition; we call this the “uniform coverage” problem. The uniform coverage problem is challenging because the atomizer emits a non-trivial paint distribution, thus making the relationships between the spray gun trajectory and the deposition uniformity complex. To understand the key issues involved in uniform coverage, we consider surface patches that are geodesically convex and topologically simple as representative of subsets of realistic automotive surfaces. In addition to ensuring uniform paint deposition on the surface, our goal is to also minimize the associated process cycle time and paint waste. Based on the relationships between the spray gun trajectory and the output characteristics (i.e., uniformity, cycle time and paint waste), our approach decomposes the coverage trajectory generation problem into three subproblems: (1) selecting a seed curve, (2) determining a speed profile along each pass, and (3) selecting the spacing between successive passes. Using concepts such as area magnification and the Gauss-Bonnet theorem from differential geometry, as well as standard optimization procedures, we present procedures to solve each subproblem independently from the others. We demonstrate our trajectory planning procedures by approximating real automotive surfaces by simple surfaces in simulation, and finally evaluate the effectiveness of our algorithms experimentally on real automotive surfaces. }

    abstract = { Demining and unexploded ordnance (UXO) clearance are extremely tedious and dangerous tasks. The use of robots bypasses the hazards and potentially increases the efficiency of both tasks. A first crucial step towards robotic mine/UXO clearance is to locate all the targets. This requires a path planner that generates a path to pass a detector over all points of a mine/UXO field, i.e., a planner that is complete.The current state of the art in path planning for mine/UXO clearance is to move a robot randomly or use simple heuristics. These methods do not possess completeness guarantees which are vital for locating all of the mines/UXOs. Using such random approaches is akin to intentionally using imperfect detectors. In this paper, we first overview our prior complete coverage algorithm and compare it with randomized approaches. In addition to the provable guarantees, we demonstrate that complete coverage achieves coverage in shorter time than random coverage. We also show that the use of complete approaches enables the creation of a filter to reject bad sensor readings, which is necessary for successful deployment of robots. We propose a new approach to handle sensor uncertainty that uses geometrical and topological features rather than sensor uncertainty models. We have verified our results by performing experiments in unstructured indoor environments. Finally, for scenarios where some a priori information about a minefield is available, we expedite the demining process by introducing a probabilistic method so that a demining robot does not have to perform exhaustive coverage. }

Even problems that can be handled by a single multi-skilled robot may benefit from the alternative usage of a robot team, since robustness and reliability can often be increased by combining several robots which are individually less robust and reliable [3]. One can find similar examples in human work: several people in line are able to move a bucket, from a water source to a fire, faster and with less individual effort. Also, if one or more of the individuals leaves the team, the task can still be accomplished by the remaining ones, even if slower than before. Another example is the surveillance of a large area by several people. If adequately coordinated, the team is able to perform the job faster and with reduced cost than a single person carrying out all the work, especially if the cost of moving over large distances is prohibitive. A larger rank of task domains, distributed sensing and action, and insight into social and life sciences are other advantages that can be brought by the study and use of MRS [22].",

    abstract = { Dynamic task allocation is an essential requirement for multi-robot systems operating in unknown dynamic environments. It allows robots to change their behavior in response to environmental changes or actions of other robots in order to improve overall system performance. Emergent coordination algorithms for task allocation that use only local sensing and no direct communication between robots are attractive because they are robust and scalable. However, a lack of formal analysis tools makes emergent coordination algorithms difficult to design. In this paper we present a mathematical model of a general dynamic task allocation mechanism. Robots using this mechanism have to choose between two types of tasks, and the goal is to achieve a desired task division in the absence of explicit communication and global knowledge. Robots estimate the state of the environment from repeated local observations and decide which task to choose based on these observations. We model the robots and observations as stochastic processes and study the dynamics of the collective behavior. Specifically, we analyze the effect that the number of observations and the choice of the decision function have on the performance of the system. The mathematical models are validated in a multi-robot multi-foraging scenario. The model's predictions agree very closely with results of embodied simulations. }

To maintain the desired leader-follower relationship, we propose a separation-bearing-orientation scheme (SBOS) for two-robot formations and separation-separation-orientation scheme (SSOS) for three-robot formations in deriving the desired postures of the followers. Unlike the other leader-follower approaches in the existing literature, the orientation deviations between the leaders and followers are explicitly controlled in our framework, which enables us to successfully solve formation controls when robots move backwards, which is termed as a formation backwards problem in this paper. Further, we propose to incorporate the receding-horizon scheme into our leader-follower controller to yield a fast convergence rate of the formation tracking errors. Experiments are finally performed on a group of mobile robots to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed formation control framework.},
