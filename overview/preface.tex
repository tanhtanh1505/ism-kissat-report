Itemset mining, a fundamental task in data mining, plays a pivotal role in discovering meaningful patterns from large datasets. It involves identifying sets of items that frequently co-occur together within transactions, providing valuable insights into associations and correlations among items.

In this thesis, we delve into the realm of itemset mining and its crucial importance in various domains such as market basket analysis, bioinformatics, and web usage mining. We explore the significance of itemset mining in uncovering hidden patterns, aiding decision-making processes, and enhancing business strategies.

Furthermore, we aim to optimize the itemset mining process by leveraging the Sequential Encounter Encoding method for SAT encoding. This innovative approach offers a novel perspective on encoding itemset mining problems into Boolean satisfiability (SAT) instances, paving the way for efficient and scalable solutions.

The subsequent chapters of this thesis are structured as follows:

\textbf{Chapter 1}: This chapter serves as an introduction to itemset mining tasks and SAT encoding. It elucidates the fundamental concepts, terminology, and real-world applications associated with these fields.

\textbf{Chapter 2}: We delve into the construction of base constraints for itemset mining problems and their encoding into SAT. This includes an exploration of the process of deriving constraints from standard itemset mining algorithms, along with an analysis of their limitations.

\textbf{Chapter 3}: Here, we discuss the Sequential Encounter Encoding method as a novel approach to encoding itemset mining problems into SAT instances. We delve into the intricacies of this encoding technique and highlight its advantages over traditional methods.

\textbf{Chapter 4}: This chapter presents the results of experimental evaluations conducted on both synthetic and real-world datasets. We compare the performance of the Sequential Encounter Encoding method with existing approaches to showcase its efficacy and scalability.

\textbf{Chapter 5}: Finally, we conclude our findings, summarizing the contributions of this research and discussing potential avenues for future exploration in the field of itemset mining and SAT encoding.

Through this thesis, we aim to contribute to the advancement of itemset mining techniques and facilitate the development of more efficient algorithms for pattern discovery in large datasets.
