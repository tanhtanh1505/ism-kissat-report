\textbf{Summary:} In this thesis, we apply the "Sequential Encounter Encoding" method to optimize itemset mining tasks. This method has been proven effective in optimizing the search process for itemsets in data. By utilizing "Sequential Encounter Encoding" we aim to enhance the performance of itemset mining algorithms while minimizing processing time.

We conduct a series of experiments on real-world datasets to evaluate the performance of the applied method. Experimental results demonstrate a significant improvement in accuracy and efficiency compared to traditional methods. The application of this method not only enhances the performance of data mining processes but also opens up potential applications for similar problems in the field of data science and information retrieval.
